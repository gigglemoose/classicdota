# 6.84 for Modern Players  
The most important thing to know about classic Dota is that it's more similar to modern Dota than it is different. Most of the heroes are about the same, most of the items are about the same, and most of the concepts are about the same as they are in modern Dota. This document outlines all of the major differences between the games, but don't let it intimidate you. There will be a learning curve, but if you've learned one game, you're already most of the way to learning the other.  

## The Big Stuff  

### The following concepts **do not exist** in 6.84: 
* **Talents**

### The following things are significantly different to how they are in modern Dota:  

#### Levels
* The maximum level is 25.
* **Talents do not exist. When you level up, you can choose to upgrade an ability, or gain 2 of all attributes** (strength, agility, and intelligence) **instead.** Usually, if you have an ability to level up, it's optimal to upgrade it, but it's occasionally good to upgrade stats before having your abilities maxed out.

#### Wards
* **Observer wards cost gold** and are mostly purchased by the hard support, with some occasional help from the position 4.
* Sentry wards do not have a stock limit and must be purchased two at a time.

#### Couriers
* **The courier must be purchased** at the start of the game. This is typically done by the hard support. 
* While more can technically be purchased, **each team typically only has one courier to share.** It usually gets monopolized by the mid laner for the first few minutes of the game. This makes starting items very important, especially in the side lanes.
* When first purchased, the courier walks, and is quite slow. **3 minutes into the game, the flying courier is unlocked in the shop.** Usually the hard support buys it unless the position 4 is having a really good game. The flying courier is much faster than the standard courier and has a speed boost ability.
* In lieu of individual couriers, **there is a side shop at both of the side lanes with a limited selection of items.** Be warned that it can be hard to reach if your lane is going poorly. 

#### Roshan
* Roshan never drops Refresher Shard or Aghanim's Scepter. He drops an Aegis every death, and a Cheese every death after the second.
* The Roshan pit is in a very different location.
* Illusions cannot hit Roshan. They are immediately destroyed if they try.

#### Runes
* **Arcane runes do not exist.**
* **Bounty runes give experience as well as gold, but only work for the hero grabbing them.** Therefore, cores tend to have priority on grabbing them.
* There are no special bounty rune locations - only the two river spots.
* **Every two minutes,** including the 2 minute mark, **two runes spawn** - one at the left river spot, one at the right river spot. **One will be a bounty, and one will be a random power rune** (which is which is random).
* At the start of the game (0:00) two bounty runes spawn instead of a bounty and power rune. **These initial bounty runes are twice as powerful** and very important.

#### The Map
The map is significantly different in classic Dota. There are fewer neutral camps, and they're in different spots. The paths throughout the map are more restrictive, forcing you to plan routes more carefully. The map is less symmetrical, creating various advantages and disadvantages to each side. Here are some of the side differences:
* It's easier for mid to farm neutrals on radiant due to camp positioning.
* Radiant offlane can side pull dire's hard camp after breaking a tree. Dire offlane cannot do the same to radiant.
* Dire can use this same hard camp to pull directly if they push the enemy offlaner back near their tower. Radiant cannot do this, but chain pulling is easier on radiant (though it requires a broken tree).
* Dire has a Roshan advantage due to the position of the pit.

## The Feel of the Game
### Tempo is Really Important
Heroes in classic Dota seem to have much more pronounced power spikes and falloffs than they do in modern Dota. Just about everybody agrees that this is true, but we haven't had much discussion as to why it is. Here's my personal analysis for the dweebs among us:
>Flat number-based spells (e.g. Crystal Maiden's Crystal Nova) will always be better in the early game than the late game, because the damage stays the same (after their fourth level is skilled) but heroes gain more health. Similar logic dictates that percentage-based spells (e.g. Spectre's Dispersion) will be comparatively better in the late game than the early game, because scaling is built in. This is also somewhat true in modern Dota, but it's tempered by the design of talents. At the time of writing, with all four points in the abilities, Crystal Nova deals 260 damage, and Dispersion reflects 22%. Each ability has a level 25 talent. Crystal Nova gets taken from 260 damage to a total of 500. Dispersion gets taken from 22% damage reflection to 27%. Proportionally speaking, 260 damage to 500 is a 92.3% increase, whereas 22% reflection to 27% is only a 22.7% increase. Obviously Spectre is still a way better late-game hero despite this, but the uneven talents give Crystal Maiden a level of late-game presence that just doesn't exist in classic Dota. This is, admittedly, a somewhat simplistic analysis, but I believe that it demonstrates a valid point.  

The consequences of the increased power spikes and falloffs only compound throughout a team's draft. Sometimes in classic Dota you simply cannot win past a certain point in the game no matter how hard the enemy team messes up or how well you play. The game becomes practically unthrowable no matter how bad the enemy team is because their late game is just that much superior. As a corollary, you'll tend to have a similarly massive advantage in early fights in this scenario. You'll either close the game out early, or you'll lose. This is *vastly* more common in classic Dota than it is in modern Dota. The timing of your team's draft is *extremely* important in classic Dota and if you don't understand it, you're destined to lose. Always consider tempo when picking your hero and playing the game.

### Games Go Longer
Matches of classic Dota tend to be a bit longer than modern Dota. The game is, in general, slower. It takes a little longer to level up and gather gold, so heroes reach their peak slightly later. There are usually fewer kills per minute and the towers often last a bit longer (except in the aforementioned scenario where one team's timing is much earlier than the other team's - they'll hopefully be taking towers at an accelerated pace that feels more like modern Dota, or even faster in extreme cases). 

### Everybody's Squishy
In 6.84, you cannot get away with the sort of stuff you can get away with in modern Dota. If you walk out of position and your opponents don't suck, you *will* die. Spells in general deal a ridiculous amount of damage in the early game (because they don't scale), and in the late game, carries are seriously scary. This is one of the first things you will notice when learning classic Dota. Every hero can, and will, get nuked into oblivion, especially in the early game. Heroes simply do not have as much survivability as they do in modern Dota and you have to be a lot more careful with your positioning. However, this does mean that your opponents will generally be easier to kill than they are in modern Dota.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
It seems increasingly true in modern Dota that pretty much every hero is at least okay at doing most things. Valve uses a variety of mechanisms to bandage the weaknesses of heroes. There are talents that bandage or even straight up delete massive vulnerabilities, (e.g. Wraith King's No Reincarnation Manacost), base kit reworks (e.g. the jump forward that was added to Ursa's slow), and new aghs effects that solve a hero's problems (e.g. Sven's aghs). Those last two make those two hard carries, whose biggest weakness has always been kiting, really hard to kite. Weaknesses are being increasingly removed from the game. When you take a roster of heroes that each has their own unique set of strengths and weaknesses and then delete the weaknesses, you're left with only strengths. You've removed half of the richness. Each hero is that much more similar to the others. It's like cooking a nice dinner of steak, corn, and potatoes, and then throwing it into a blender. Something magical is lost. 

There's also something to be said about net worth here. Supports in particular in modern Dota are way, way richer than they are in 6.84. This is because of the modern bounty rune system, free support items, and quite possibly some assorted gold formula stuff. Most supports don't have mobility anywhere in their kit, but in modern Dota, it doesn't matter - they can always afford a blink, or a force staff, or at least a glimmer cape or ghost scepter or something to get people off of them. It's fairly normal in 6.84 for hard supports to get their first real item at around the 30 minute mark. In modern Dota, it's more like 20. That difference is huge. If a hero doesn't have something built into their already bloated kit, they can probably buy it, especially with all of the modern items available. Any hero can do pretty much anything. This also makes each hero's strengths that much less unique - how special can something be if anybody can buy it from a shop? This simply doesn't exist in classic Dota, and the heroes are that much vibrant and rich because of it. Personally, I prefer my steak and potatoes side by side, not turned into some odd beige-ish paste by a blender.

When you're new to 6.84, your opponents' heroes will probably feel overpowered and your hero may very well feel useless. Just about every hero feels really overpowered in ideal circumstances and almost completely worthless in bad circumstances. If you do not punish your opponents' weaknesses, they'll have their strengths at no cost and feel insanely overpowered. If you don't know your own strengths, your weaknesses will be punished but there will be no payoff. Every hero has very distinct and specific strengths and weaknesses in classic Dota. You have to pick your hero very carefully. You will win and lose games in the draft. You can't buy your way out of every bad situation, or wait for a talent to save you if you mess up and pick Wraith King against Anti-Mage or Phantom Lancer. When you can't fix your mistakes, it becomes even more important not to make them in the first place. Do things right the first time, or you will feel the consequences.
