# 6.84 for Modern Players  
The most important thing to know about classic Dota is that it's more similar to modern Dota than it is different. Most of the heroes are about the same, most of the items are about the same, and most of the concepts are about the same as they are in modern Dota. This document outlines all of the major differences between the games, but don't let it intimidate you. There will be a learning curve, but if you've learned one game, you're already most of the way to learning the other.  

## The Big Stuff  

### The following concepts **do not exist** in 6.84: 
* **Talents**
* **Neutral items**

* **Status Resistance, Mana Loss Reduction and Spell Amplification** (Veil of Discord gives Magic Damage Amplification)
* **Aghanim's Shard**
* Some heroes do not have an Aghanim's Scepter upgrade, and many heroes have different upgrades than they do in modern Dota.
* Cast range cannot be increased
* Attack range cannot be increased (excluding Sniper and Templar Assassin's abilities)
* There are no tower range indicators. There are no neutral camp spawn box indicators or stack/pull timers.

### The following things are significantly different to how they are in modern Dota:  

#### Levels
* The maximum level is 25.
* **Talents do not exist. When you level up, you can choose to upgrade an ability, or gain 2 of all attributes** (strength, agility, and intelligence) **instead.** Usually, if you have an ability to level up, it's optimal to upgrade it, but it's occasionally good to upgrade stats before having your abilities maxed out.

#### Wards
* **Observer wards cost gold** and are mostly purchased by the hard support, with some occasional help from the position 4.
* Sentry wards do not have a stock limit and must be purchased two at a time.

#### Couriers
* **The courier must be purchased** at the start of the game. This is typically done by the hard support. 
* While more can technically be purchased, **each team typically only has one courier to share.** It usually gets monopolized by the mid laner for the first few minutes of the game. This makes starting items very important, especially in the side lanes.
* When first purchased, the courier walks, and is quite slow. **3 minutes into the game, the flying courier is unlocked in the shop.** Usually the hard support buys it unless the position 4 is having a really good game. The flying courier is much faster than the standard courier and has a speed boost ability.
* In lieu of individual couriers, **there is a side shop at both of the side lanes with a limited selection of items.** Be warned that it can be hard to reach if your lane is going poorly. 

#### Roshan
* Roshan never drops Refresher Shard or Aghanim's Scepter. He drops an Aegis every death, and a Cheese every death after the second.
* The Roshan pit is in a very different location.
* Illusions cannot hit Roshan. They are immediately destroyed if they try.

#### Runes
* **Arcane runes do not exist.**
* **Bounty runes give experience as well as gold, but only work for the hero grabbing them.** Therefore, cores tend to have priority on grabbing them.
* There are no special bounty rune locations - only the two river spots.
* **Every two minutes,** including the 2 minute mark, **two runes spawn** - one at the left river spot, one at the right river spot. **One will be a bounty, and one will be a random power rune** (which is which is random).
* At the start of the game (0:00) two bounty runes spawn instead of a bounty and power rune. **These initial bounty runes are twice as powerful** and very important.

#### The Map
The map is significantly different in classic Dota. There are fewer neutral camps, and they're in different spots. The paths throughout the map are more restrictive, which forces players to plan routes more carefully. The map is less symmetrical, creating various advantages and disadvantages to each side. Here are some of the side differences:
* It's easier for mid to farm neutrals on radiant due to camp positioning.
* Radiant offlane can side pull dire's hard camp after breaking a tree. Dire offlane cannot do the same to radiant.
* Dire can use this same hard camp to pull directly if they push the enemy offlaner back near their tower. Radiant cannot do this, but chain pulling is easier on radiant (though it requires a broken tree).
* Dire has a Roshan advantage due to the position of the pit.

Also, the farming triangle doesn't exist. The offlane only has the ancient camp. This contributes to the difficulty of the offlane and further nudges cores towards incorporating creep waves into their farming patterns.

#### Regen
Salves, clarities, and bottle charges get canceled by creep damage, whether they're neutral or enemy creeps. This makes all-in plays in the lane harder to pull off. It also means that spellcasting mid laners can't clear the jungle super quickly while keeping their mana levels high with clarities.

## The Feel of the Game
### Tempo is Really Important
There's a lot to say about tempo, so I've given it its own page that can be read [here.](./tempo.md) As a brief summary, games tend to go a bit longer and supports don't scale as well.

### Everybody's Squishy
In 6.84, you cannot get away with the sort of stuff you can get away with in modern Dota. If you walk out of position and your opponents don't suck, you *will* die. Spells in general deal a ridiculous amount of damage in the early game (because they don't scale), and in the late game, carries become even scarier. This is one of the first things you will notice when playing classic Dota. Every hero can, and will, get nuked into oblivion, especially in the early game. Heroes simply do not have as much survivability as they do in modern Dota, which forces players to be a lot more careful with their positioning. Conversely, this does mean that your opponents will generally be easier to kill than they are in modern Dota.

### Creeps are OP
Heroes are less powerful relative to creeps. Tanking the creep wave tends to be a very bad idea. Pushing waves is very time consuming (and can be very dangerous) if your hero isn't particularly good at it. It also takes most heroes slightly longer to clear neutral camps.

### More Down Time
When playing modern Dota, it feels as though the fighting never stops. It's common to reach two kills per minute, whereas this rarely happens in classic Dota. Excluding deathball and cheese strategies, players tend to heavily emphasize pushing lanes and clearing the jungle. The increased prevalence of split pushing makes it easier to avoid fights by forcing the enemy team back to base.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
It seems increasingly true in modern Dota that pretty much every hero is at least okay at doing most things. Valve uses a variety of mechanisms to bandage the weaknesses of heroes. There are talents that bandage or even straight up delete massive vulnerabilities, (e.g. Wraith King's No Reincarnation Manacost), base kit reworks (e.g. the jump forward that was added to Ursa's slow), and new aghs effects that solve a hero's problems (e.g. Sven's aghs... how the hell did they think that was a good idea?). Those last two make those two hard carries, whose biggest weakness has always been kiting, really hard to kite. Weaknesses are being increasingly removed from the game. When you take a roster of heroes that each has their own unique set of strengths and weaknesses and then delete the weaknesses, you're left with only strengths. You've removed half of the richness. Each hero is that much more similar to the others and something special is lost. 

When you're new to 6.84, your opponents' heroes will probably feel overpowered and your hero may very well feel useless. Just about every hero feels really overpowered in ideal circumstances and almost completely worthless in bad circumstances. If you do not punish your opponents' weaknesses, they'll have their strengths at no cost and feel insanely overpowered. If you don't know your own strengths, your weaknesses will be punished but there will be no payoff. Every hero has very distinct and specific strengths and weaknesses in classic Dota. You have to pick your hero very carefully. You will win and lose games in the draft. You can't buy your way out of every bad situation, or wait for a talent to save you if you mess up and pick Wraith King against Anti-Mage or Phantom Lancer. When you can't fix your mistakes, it becomes even more important not to make them in the first place. Do things right the first time, or you will feel the consequences. **You must plan ahead - you cannot simply react.**
